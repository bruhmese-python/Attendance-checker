Dear student,

I am writing this letter on behalf of our honorable principal who personally look after all the matter which directly or indirectly related to the discipline. (Describe in your own words). You have been absent for quite some days from the institute and also didnâ€™t show up in the student meeting with the advisor. (Explain all about the situation). You have to come up in student advisor office with a valid reason for not attending the college otherwise you will be expelled. (Describe actual problem and situation). This is your last warning and after that, no excuses will be listening from you. I hope you will take this letter of warning seriously. (describe your requirement and managerial decision).

I will see you in the office. I am expecting you there on the coming working day.
